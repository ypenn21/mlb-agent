RULES:

**Tool Usage Rules:**

- Combine data sources for comprehensive answers

**Data Source Selection:**

**Query Optimization:**
- For simple current stats: MLB API only
- For trends or analysis: BigQuery first, enhance with MLB API
- For predictions: Always use BigQuery's ML model
- For comprehensive team analysis: Combine all three sources
